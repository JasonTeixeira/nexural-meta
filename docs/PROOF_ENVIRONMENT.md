# Proof Environment

**Status:** Internal proof environment lock
**Owner:** Sage Ideas LLC
**Generated:** 2026-06-01T21:35:40.302Z
**Overall:** passed

## Purpose

This document defines the internal environment needed to keep the app factory proof repeatable. It records secret names, rotation policy, hosted health, and golden-path evidence without storing secret values.

## Run It

```bash
pnpm proof:env
```

## Hosted Runtime

- URL: https://sage-client-intake-portal-vercel-8f62ooaxe-sage-ideas.vercel.app
- HTTP status: 200
- Database mode: crud_probe
- Database operation: insert-read-update-delete

## Evidence

- Latest run: `rag-knowledge-chat-2026-06-01T213051295Z`
- App hash: `sha256:3747581a28b026151e03af27ae35282aeaab8c4c98724e58a4da737986b1abd4`
- Gates: 16/16
- Evidence hash: `sha256:34d11e9baaac3f06cc1bfa385d19db6f1e7063592e99d7e16811ac16d77b8b8a`

## Operating Rules

- No secret values are written to evidence, docs, or generated public-safe JSON.
- SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN is an operator-only personal token and must not be persisted as a GitHub secret.
- Any personal access token pasted into chat, logs, or screenshots must be revoked and replaced.
- Hosted proof is not green unless /api/health verifies DB CRUD against staging Postgres.
- Generated app evidence links run ID, app tree hash, deployed URL, and gate results.

## Next Actions

- **security: Revoke any Supabase personal access token exposed outside the terminal.** Personal access tokens are operator credentials and are never persisted by this repo.
